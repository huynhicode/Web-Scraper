## Web Scraper 

**Part 1 Spec:**

Write a script that will scrape the contents of three websites that you define and saves them on the local disk as .html pages. 

The three websites that I have chosen are:
- https://www.dmv.ca.gov
- https://www.google.com
- https://www.nasa.gov

**Instructions on how to run the Part 1 spec:**

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
1. Run `yarn scrape` to execute the web scraper script.
1. Observe that a `scraped-html` folder is created with html files for the following websites:
- https://www.dmv.ca.gov - dmv.html
- https://www.google.com - google.html
- https://www.nasa.gov - nasa.html
